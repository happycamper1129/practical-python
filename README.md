# Practical Python Programming

When I first learned Python nearly 25 years ago, I was immediately
struck by the ease at which I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy
work projects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching
others the same fun.  The result of that teaching is this
course--A no-nonsense Python course that has been actively taught to more than 400
in-person groups since 2007.  Traders, systems admins, astronomers,
NASA rocket scientists, and even a few software engineers--they've all
taken this course.  Now, the course is available for all.  Enjoy!

## Prerequisites and Target Audience

The material you see here is the core of an instructor-led Python
training course.  It is typically taught in-person over the span of
three or four days--requiring approximately 25-35 hours of work. This
includes the completion of approximately 130 hands on coding exercises.

The target audience is scientists, engineers, and programmers who
already have experience in at least one other programming language. No
prior knowledge of Python is required, but knowledge of common
programming topics is assumed.  Most participants find the course
challenging--even if they've already been doing a bit of Python 
programming.

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python
programming with an emphasis on script writing, data manipulation, and
program organization. The course does NOT focus on Python tooling,
IDEs, or third-party packages (i.e., it's not focused on using data
science libraries in Jupyter Notebooks or on how to deploy web apps).
It IS a course that aims to cover fundamental ideas about how Python
programs work and how they are organized.  Students WILL have to write
functions and classes, work with code spread across multiple source
files, deal with modules, and solve various problems related to
refactoring.

To complete this course, you simply need a basic installation of
Python 3.6 or newer and time to work on it--especially the latter.

## What This Course is Not

This is not a course for absolute beginners on how to program a
computer.  It is assumed that you already have programming experience
in some other programming language or Python itself.

This is not a course that aims to cover everything there is to know
about Python.  There is only so much material you can cover in 3-4 days
before heads start to explode.  If you're working through the material
and wondering "why isn't X being covered?" there's probably a good 
reason--it was once included and it made everyone's head explode.

This is not a course that simply covers reference material, tricks, or
recipes that you could just look up on [python.org](https://python.org),
Google, or Stack Overflow. Yes, there is a certain amount of reference
material to be functional, but the course is more focused on how to
work with and think about Python coding.

This is not a course for software engineers on how to write or
maintain a one-million line Python program. I don't write programs
like that and neither should you. Delete something already! 
Python is a great language for personal productivity, prototyping ideas,
and hacking cool things together. The course is about doing THAT in
a way that's both practical and not too "hacky."
