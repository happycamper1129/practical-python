# Overview

## Object Oriented (OO) programming

A Programming technique where code is organized as a collection of *objects*.

An *object* consists of:

* Data. Attributes
* Behavior. Methods, functions applied to the object.

You have already been using some OO during this course.

For example with Lists.

```python
>>> nums = [1, 2, 3]
>>> nums.append(4)      # Method
>>> nums.insert(1,10)   # Method
>>> nums
[1, 10, 2, 3, 4]        # Data
>>>
```

`nums` is an *instance* of a list.

Methods (`append` and `insert`) are attached to the instance (`nums`).

## Summary

This will be a high-level overview of classes.

Most code involving classes will involve the topics covered in this section.

If you're merely using existing libraries, the code is typically fairly simple.
